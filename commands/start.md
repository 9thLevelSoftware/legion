<process>
1. PRE-FLIGHT CHECK
   - Check if `.planning/PROJECT.md` already exists by attempting to read it
   - If it exists: issue AskUserQuestion.

     Question: "A project already exists in .planning/. Choose exactly one of two actions."

     **Select one option:**
     - **Overwrite existing project with fresh start** — irreversible; PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, and STATE.md will be replaced
     - **Keep existing project and abort /legion:start** — no files modified; run `/legion:status` instead

     Do not propose a third option. Do not merge or archive.

     → Use AskUserQuestion tool with these exact two options.
   - If it doesn't exist: proceed directly

2. EXPLORATION OFFER
   After pre-flight check passes (no existing project OR user confirmed reinitialize):

   Issue AskUserQuestion.

   Question: "Choose exactly one of two planning entry paths."

   **Select one option:**
   - **Yes, explore with Polymath** — invoke `/legion:explore` to crystallize the concept before planning
   - **No, jump straight to planning** — skip exploration and proceed directly to brownfield detection

   Do not pre-select. Do not propose exploration with a different agent.

   → Use AskUserQuestion tool with these exact two options.

   **If user selects "Yes, explore with Polymath":**
   - Invoke `/legion:explore` workflow
   - `/legion:explore` has its own exit states ("Proceed to planning", "Explore more", "Park"); those are handled inside that command, not here
   - When `/legion:explore` returns with exit state "Proceed to planning":
     - Capture the crystallized concept from exploration output
     - Pre-populate Stage 1 (Vision & Identity) questioning with the crystallized summary
     - Skip the opening "What are you building?" prompt
     - Continue to brownfield detection (step 3)
   - When `/legion:explore` returns with exit state "Explore more":
     - Loop back to `/legion:explore` with narrowed scope
   - When `/legion:explore` returns with exit state "Park":
     - Exit with summary saved to `.planning/exploration-{timestamp}.md`

   **If user selects "No, jump straight to planning":**
   - Skip exploration
   - Continue directly to brownfield detection (step 3)
   - Proceed with standard questioning flow

3. BROWNFIELD DETECTION
   Follow codebase-mapper skill Section 1 (Source Code Detection Heuristic):
   - Check for non-Legion source files in the current directory:
     - Any source files outside .planning/, .claude/, .codex/, .cursor/, .windsurf/, .gemini/, .opencode/, and .aider/?
     - Any package.json, Gemfile, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, go.mod at root?
     - Any src/, app/, lib/, components/ directories?
   - If existing source code detected:
     Use adapter.ask_user:
       "I see an existing codebase here. Should I map it before we plan?"
       Option 1: "Yes, analyze the codebase first"
         → Run codebase-mapper Sections 2-4 to build the structural map
         → Write .planning/CODEBASE.md using Section 5 format
         → Display summary: "{N} files across {M} languages, {framework} detected, {risk_count} risk areas flagged"
         → Continue to step 4
       Option 2: "No, skip the analysis"
         → Proceed directly to step 4 (greenfield mode)
       Option 3: "I'll run /legion:plan directly"
         → Abort start, let user plan manually
   - If no existing source code detected:
     Skip brownfield flow entirely (pure greenfield) — proceed to step 4
   
   **Integration with Exploration:**
   If exploration was completed (user chose "Yes, explore with Polymath"):
   - Display: "Exploration summary: [crystallized summary]"
   - Use this context during brownfield analysis
   - If existing codebase detected, ask: "Build on the existing code to realize your explored concept, or start fresh?"

4. ENSURE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
   - Create `.planning/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Create `.planning/phases/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Verify `skills/questioning-flow/templates/` exists (required — fail with clear error if missing)

5. QUESTIONING STAGE 1: VISION & IDENTITY
   Follow the questioning-flow skill's Stage 1 exactly, with exploration integration:

   **First: Check for saved exploration files (even if explore wasn't run this session)**
   - Look for `.planning/exploration-*.md` files
   - If found: read the most recent one (by filename or modification time)
   - Extract: Crystallized Summary, Knowns, Unknowns, Decisions Made
   - Set exploration_context = extracted data
   - This covers the case where `/legion:explore` ran in a PREVIOUS session

   **If exploration was completed (inline or from saved file):**
   - Skip: "What are you building? Give me the elevator pitch."
   - Instead open with: "Here's what we crystallized in exploration: [summary]. Let's confirm the details."
   - Pre-populate: project_name, project_description, value_proposition from exploration
   - Focus questioning on what's still missing or needs confirmation
   - Display source: "Loaded from `.planning/exploration-{name}.md`" (if from saved file)

   **If no exploration (user chose "No, jump straight to planning" AND no saved exploration files):**
   - Keep existing Stage 1 flow unchanged:
     - Open with: "What are you building? Give me the elevator pitch."
     - Ask follow-up questions adaptively based on what's missing from the response
     - Capture: project_name, project_description, value_proposition, target_users
     - Summarize and confirm: "Here's what I'm understanding: [summary]. Anything to correct or add?"
     - Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

6. QUESTIONING STAGE 2: REQUIREMENTS & CONSTRAINTS
   Follow the questioning-flow skill's Stage 2 exactly:
   - Ask: "What are the must-have features for v1?"
   - Ask: "What's explicitly out of scope?"
   - Adapt follow-ups based on project type detected in Stage 1
   - Capture: requirements_list, out_of_scope, constraints, architecture_notes, decisions
   - Summarize requirements as bullet list and confirm with user

7. QUESTIONING STAGE 3: WORKFLOW PREFERENCES
   Follow the questioning-flow skill's Stage 3 exactly:
   - Use adapter.ask_user with 3 structured choice questions:
     - Execution mode: Guided (Recommended) / Autonomous / Collaborative
     - Planning depth: Standard (Recommended) / Quick Sketch / Deep Analysis
     - Cost profile: Balanced (Recommended) / Economy / Premium
   - Record choices as decisions

8. GENERATE PROJECT.MD
   - Read `skills/questioning-flow/templates/project-template.md` for the structure
   - Fill all placeholders using the output mapping from questioning-flow skill Section 3
   - Omit sections with no content (don't write "N/A")
   - Write the completed document to `.planning/PROJECT.md`

9. GENERATE ROADMAP.MD
   - Analyze requirements captured in Stage 2
   - Follow phase decomposition guidelines from questioning-flow skill Section 4:
     - Group requirements by dependency and domain
     - Order phases: foundation → core features → user-facing → polish
     - Size each phase for 2-3 plans
     - Name phases descriptively
   - For each phase, use the agent-registry skill's recommendation algorithm (Section 3):
     - Match phase requirements against agent task types
     - Select 2-4 recommended agents per phase
     - Ensure testing agent for code phases, coordinator for cross-division work
   - Define testable success criteria per phase
   - Read `skills/questioning-flow/templates/roadmap-template.md` for the structure
   - Fill placeholders and write to `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

10. GENERATE STATE.MD
    - Read `skills/questioning-flow/templates/state-template.md` for the structure
    - Fill placeholders:
      - total_phases: count from roadmap
      - total_plans: sum of estimated plans across all phases
      - progress_bar / progress_percent: initialized to 0
      - recent_decisions: workflow preferences from Stage 3
      - first_phase_name: name of Phase 1
      - date: current date
    - Write to `.planning/STATE.md`

11. REGISTER IN PORTFOLIO
    Follow portfolio-manager Section 2 (Register Project):
    a. Check if `{adapter.global_config_dir}` directory exists; create it if not (including parent directories)
    b. Read `{adapter.global_config_dir}/portfolio.md` if it exists; otherwise initialize with empty structure:
       ```
       # Legion Portfolio
       ## Projects
       ## Cross-Project Dependencies
       | ID | From | To | Type | Status | Notes |
       |----|------|----|------|--------|-------|
       ## Metadata
       - **Last Updated**: {today}
       - **Total Projects**: 0
       - **Active Projects**: 0
       ```
    c. Get the absolute path of the current working directory
    d. Check if this path is already registered under any project heading
       - If yes: update the project name and description to match current PROJECT.md
       - If no: add a new project entry:
         ```
         ### {project_name}
         - **Path**: {absolute_path}
         - **Status**: Active
         - **Registered**: {today}
         - **Description**: {one-line from PROJECT.md}
         ```
    e. Update Metadata: Last Updated, Total Projects count, Active Projects count
    f. Write the updated `{adapter.global_config_dir}/portfolio.md`
    g. Display: "Registered in portfolio: {adapter.global_config_dir}/portfolio.md"

12. DISPLAY SUMMARY
    - Show the user a concise summary:
      - Project: {project_name} — {one-line description}
      - Phases: {count} phases planned
      - For each phase: name and recommended agent count
      - Workflow: {mode}, {depth}, {cost_profile}
      - Files created: PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md
      - Portfolio: Registered at {adapter.global_config_dir}/portfolio.md
    - End with: "Run `/legion:plan 1` to begin Phase 1: {first_phase_name}"
    - Do NOT dump full file contents — summary only

<decision_matrix>
| Situation | Action | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Exploration completed (inline) | Use crystallized summary in Stage 1 | Pre-populate questioning with exploration output |
| Exploration file found from previous session | Load and use in Stage 1 | Check `.planning/exploration-*.md` — context persists across sessions |
| User skipped exploration, no saved files | Run standard Stage 1 questioning | No changes to existing flow |
| Exploration parked | Exit start command, exploration already saved | User can re-run start later — file will be found automatically |
</decision_matrix>
</process>
