## Findings Detail

| # | Severity | File | Issue | Fix Applied | Cycle Fixed |
|---|----------|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | WARNING | recommendation-engine.js | Null/undefined prompt crashes engine | Added input validation with graceful return | 1 |
| 2 | WARNING | recommendation-engine.js | NaN propagation from non-numeric memoryScores | Added Number.isFinite guard | 1 |
| 3 | WARNING | recommendation-engine.js | parseCatalog missing try/catch | Wrapped in try/catch matching parseAgentMetadata pattern | 1 |
| 4 | WARNING | recommendation-engine.js | Unused promptLower parameter in metadataScore/detectTaskType | Removed from signatures and call sites | 1 |
| 5 | WARNING | recommendation-engine.js | Hardcoded coordinator IDs in 3 locations | Extracted to COORDINATOR_IDS constant (Set) | 1 |
| 6 | WARNING | recommendation-engine.js | Mutation of parsed catalog objects | Changed to spread operator creating new objects | 1 |
| 7 | WARNING | recommendation-engine.test.js | metadataScore tested with 1 of 5 paths (~30%) | Added 4 tests covering artifact_types, review_strengths, partial match, no-metadata, unmatched | 1 |
| 8 | WARNING | recommendation-engine.test.js | archetype_gating test has vacuous assertion | Rewritten to verify zero-baseline agent exclusion | 1 |
| 9 | WARNING | recommendation-engine.test.js | classifyConfidence has no unit test | Exported function, added 4 boundary assertions | 1 |
| 10 | WARNING | recommendation-engine.test.js | Tests coupled to live filesystem | Accepted — integration tests require real agent files | 1 |

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Reviewer | Rubric | Cycle 1 Verdict | Key Observations |
|----------|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| testing-qa-verification-specialist | Production Readiness | NEEDS WORK | Error handling gaps: null prompt crash, NaN propagation, asymmetric try/catch |
| engineering-senior-developer | Code Architecture | PASS | Clean 4-layer scoring; DRY violation and mutation pattern flagged |
| testing-test-results-analyzer | Test Quality Metrics | NEEDS WORK | metadataScore at ~30% path coverage; vacuous assertion; classifyConfidence untested |

## Suggestions (noted, not required)

1. Negative topN values produce unexpected results — clamp added as part of input validation
2. Negative successRate × totalOutcomes double-negative in archetypeBoost
3. recommendAgents is 115 lines with 6 responsibilities — consider extracting helpers
4. Metadata weights are magic numbers — consider named constant
5. metadataScore test could isolate per-field contributions
6. memory-manager tests are spec-validation only (by design)
7. Fixture JSON parse at module load risks unhelpful crash on malformed JSON
8. Filesystem coupling should have guard assertions
9. Non-sequential step numbering in SKILL.md (fixed as part of cycle 1)

## Test Results

```
Cycle 2 (post-fix):
node --test tests/recommendation-engine.test.js — 34/34 pass
node --test tests/memory-manager.test.js — 5/5 pass
```
