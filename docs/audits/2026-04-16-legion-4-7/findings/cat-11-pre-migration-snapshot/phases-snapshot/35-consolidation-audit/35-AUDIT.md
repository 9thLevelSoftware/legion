## Command Inventory

| Command | Purpose | Skills Loaded | Overlap Status |
|---------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| `/legion:start` | Initialize a new project with guided questioning flow | workflow-common, agent-registry, questioning-flow, portfolio-manager, codebase-mapper | No overlap — unique entry point for project initialization |
| `/legion:plan` | Plan a specific phase with agent recommendations and wave-structured tasks | workflow-common, agent-registry, phase-decomposer, memory-manager, github-sync, codebase-mapper, marketing-workflows, design-workflows, plan-critique, spec-pipeline | No overlap — unique entry point for phase planning |
| `/legion:build` | Execute current phase plans with parallel agent teams | workflow-common, agent-registry, wave-executor, execution-tracker, memory-manager, github-sync | No overlap — unique entry point for phase execution |
| `/legion:review` | Run quality review cycle with testing/QA agents | workflow-common, agent-registry, review-loop, review-panel, execution-tracker, memory-manager, github-sync, design-workflows | No overlap — unique entry point for quality review |
| `/legion:status` | Show project progress dashboard and route to next action | workflow-common, execution-tracker, milestone-tracker, memory-manager, github-sync | No overlap — read-only dashboard display |
| `/legion:quick` | Run a single ad-hoc task with intelligent agent selection | workflow-common, agent-registry | No overlap — lightweight single-task execution outside phases |
| `/legion:advise` | Get read-only expert consultation from 51 agent personalities | workflow-common, agent-registry | No overlap — read-only advisory, no state changes |
| `/legion:agent` | Create a new agent personality through a guided workflow | workflow-common, agent-registry, agent-creator | No overlap — unique entry point for agent creation |
| `/legion:milestone` | Milestone management — status, definition, completion, archiving | workflow-common, milestone-tracker, execution-tracker, github-sync | No overlap — unique entry point for milestone lifecycle |
| `/legion:portfolio` | Multi-project portfolio dashboard with cross-project dependency tracking | workflow-common, portfolio-manager, agent-registry | No overlap — global cross-project view |

**Result**: No command-level redundancy found. All 10 commands have distinct entry point purposes. `/legion:status` and `/legion:build` both read STATE.md but for different purposes (display vs execution context). `/legion:quick` and `/legion:build` both execute agents but at different scopes (single ad-hoc task vs full phase). Differentiation is clear in all cases.

| workflow-common | common, shared, paths, conventions, state, config | Shared constants, state file paths, personality injection pattern, Agent Team conventions, memory conventions | All 10 commands | No overlap — utility hub, not a workflow |

**Result**: No skill-level redundancy found. The review-loop/review-panel trigger overlap on "review" is documented and intentional — they are parent/child components, not duplicates. All 18 skills are referenced by at least one command in execution_context blocks. No orphaned skills.

## Agent Inventory by Division

### Engineering Division (7 agents)

| Agent File | Name | Description | Task Types |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| engineering-senior-developer | Senior Developer | Premium implementation specialist | senior-dev, full-stack, code-review, architecture |
| engineering-backend-architect | Backend Architect | Scalable system design, database architecture, API development | backend, api-design, database, microservices |
| engineering-frontend-developer | Frontend Developer | Modern web technologies, React/Vue/Angular, performance | frontend, react, ui-implementation, performance |
| engineering-ai-engineer | AI Engineer | ML model development, deployment, AI-powered applications | ml, ai-integration, data-pipelines, llm |
| engineering-devops-automator | DevOps Automator | Infrastructure automation, CI/CD, cloud operations | devops, ci-cd, infrastructure, automation |
| engineering-mobile-app-builder | Mobile App Builder | Native iOS/Android and cross-platform development | mobile, ios, android, react-native |
| engineering-rapid-prototyper | Rapid Prototyper | Ultra-fast proof-of-concept, MVP creation | prototyping, mvp, rapid-development, poc |

**Overlap analysis**: No unintentional overlap. engineering-senior-developer and engineering-backend-architect have the closest descriptions but serve different scopes: senior-developer is the general execution lead while backend-architect is the system design specialist. They work together rather than competing. engineering-rapid-prototyper is clearly differentiated by its speed-over-quality philosophy (explicitly not for production code).

### Design Division (6 agents)

| Agent File | Name | Description | Task Types |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| design-ui-designer | UI Designer | Visual design systems, component libraries, interface creation | design-system, ui-components, accessibility, figma |
| design-ux-architect | UX Architect | Technical architecture, CSS systems, implementation guidance | ux-architecture, css-systems, information-architecture |
| design-ux-researcher | UX Researcher | User behavior analysis, usability testing, research insights | user-research, usability-testing, personas, journey-mapping |
| design-brand-guardian | Brand Guardian | Brand identity, consistency, strategic positioning | brand-identity, brand-consistency, visual-identity |
| design-visual-storyteller | Visual Storyteller | Visual narratives, multimedia content, brand storytelling | visual-storytelling, motion-design, multimedia-content |
| design-whimsy-injector | Whimsy Injector | Personality, delight, playful elements, memorable interactions | ux-delight, micro-interactions, brand-personality |

**Overlap analysis**: No unintentional overlap. design-ui-designer and design-ux-architect share UI concerns but are differentiated: UI Designer owns the visual system; UX Architect owns the structural/technical implementation. design-brand-guardian and design-visual-storyteller both touch brand but at different output levels: guardian = compliance/strategy, storyteller = multimedia execution.

### Marketing Division (8 agents)

| Agent File | Name | Description | Task Types |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| marketing-social-media-strategist | Social Media Strategist | Cross-platform strategy layer — WHERE to be, WHAT mix, HOW to allocate | social-strategy, platform-selection, content-mix, cross-platform |
| marketing-content-creator | Content Creator | Multi-platform campaigns, editorial calendars, brand storytelling | content-strategy, copywriting, editorial-calendar, brand-voice |
| marketing-growth-hacker | Growth Hacker | Data-driven user acquisition, viral loops, conversion funnels | growth, user-acquisition, funnel-optimization, viral-loops |
| marketing-twitter-engager | Twitter Engager | Real-time Twitter engagement, thought leadership, community growth | twitter, thought-leadership, twitter-engagement |
| marketing-instagram-curator | Instagram Curator | Visual storytelling, community building, multi-format Instagram content | instagram, visual-content, community-management |
| marketing-tiktok-strategist | TikTok Strategist | Viral content, algorithm optimization, TikTok culture | tiktok, viral-content, short-form-video |
| marketing-reddit-community-builder | Reddit Community Builder | Authentic Reddit engagement, value-driven content, community relationships | reddit, community-building, reddit-culture |
| marketing-app-store-optimizer | App Store Optimizer | ASO, conversion rate optimization, app discoverability | aso, app-store, conversion-optimization, app-discoverability |

**Overlap analysis**: No unintentional overlap. The 4 platform specialists (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit) serve distinct platforms with distinct content formats and community norms. marketing-social-media-strategist is the strategy layer ABOVE the platform specialists — it decides which platforms to use, not how to use them. marketing-content-creator serves as the cross-platform content engine (copy, calendars, brand voice). marketing-growth-hacker focuses on acquisition/conversion metrics rather than content creation. marketing-app-store-optimizer is completely separate (app stores, not social platforms).

### Product Division (3 agents)

| Agent File | Name | Description | Task Types |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| product-feedback-synthesizer | Feedback Synthesizer | Collecting and synthesizing user feedback into actionable priorities | user-feedback, synthesis, product-insights, priority-scoring |
| product-sprint-prioritizer | Sprint Prioritizer | Sprint planning, feature prioritization, resource allocation | sprint-planning, backlog-management, feature-prioritization |
| product-trend-researcher | Trend Researcher | Market intelligence, competitive analysis, opportunity assessment | market-research, competitive-analysis, trend-analysis |

**Overlap analysis**: No overlap. Three clearly distinct product functions: research (trend-researcher), prioritization (sprint-prioritizer), and feedback synthesis (feedback-synthesizer).

### Project Management Division (5 agents)

| Agent File | Name | Description | Task Types |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| project-manager-senior | Senior Project Manager | Task-level PM: spec → implementable tasks, acceptance criteria, scope management | task-breakdown, spec-to-tasks, scope-management, sprint-execution |
| project-management-project-shepherd | Project Shepherd | Phase-level coordination, timeline management, stakeholder alignment | project-coordination, timeline-management, stakeholder-alignment |
| project-management-studio-operations | Studio Operations | Day-to-day studio efficiency, process optimization, resource coordination | operations, process-optimization, resource-coordination |
| project-management-studio-producer | Studio Producer | Strategic multi-project orchestration, portfolio management, C-suite alignment | portfolio-management, strategic-planning, resource-allocation |
| project-management-experiment-tracker | Experiment Tracker | A/B tests, feature experiments, hypothesis validation | experimentation, ab-testing, hypothesis-validation |

**Overlap analysis**: Differentiated by scope grain: project-manager-senior (task-level within a plan), project-shepherd (phase-level coordination), studio-operations (day-to-day efficiency), studio-producer (multi-project strategic). experiment-tracker is clearly distinct (experimentation science, not coordination). The three operational PMs (senior, shepherd, operations) have adjacent scope but operate at different levels of abstraction — they are complementary, not competing.

### Testing Division (7 agents)

| Agent File | Name | Description | Task Types |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| testing-qa-verification-specialist | Reality Checker | Evidence-based certification, defaults to NEEDS WORK, stops fantasy approvals | evidence-collection, code-review, acceptance-testing, quality-gate |
| testing-evidence-collector | Evidence Collector | Screenshot-obsessed QA requiring visual proof for everything | visual-testing, screenshot-proof, ux-testing, user-flows |
| testing-api-tester | API Tester | Comprehensive API validation, performance testing, integration testing | api-testing, integration-testing, contract-testing |
| testing-performance-benchmarker | Performance Benchmarker | Measuring, analyzing, and improving system performance | performance-testing, benchmarking, load-testing |
| testing-test-results-analyzer | Test Results Analyzer | Test result evaluation, quality metrics, actionable insights | test-analysis, quality-metrics, reporting |
| testing-tool-evaluator | Tool Evaluator | Evaluating and recommending tools, software, platforms | tool-assessment, technology-evaluation, vendor-selection |
| testing-workflow-optimizer | Workflow Optimizer | Testing/QA workflow optimization: pipeline efficiency, CI optimization, flaky test detection | workflow-optimization, ci-optimization, test-pipeline, flaky-tests |

**Overlap analysis**: No unintentional overlap. testing-qa-verification-specialist and testing-evidence-collector both do QA but reality-checker is the gatekeeper/certifier while evidence-collector focuses on visual proof collection. testing-tool-evaluator's overlap with testing domain is legitimate — it evaluates testing tools specifically. testing-workflow-optimizer's Testing division placement is appropriate (post-Phase 35 fix): it optimizes *testing* workflows, not general business processes.

### Support Division (6 agents)

| Agent File | Name | Description | Task Types |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| support-analytics-reporter | Analytics Reporter | Post-analysis delivery: dashboards, KPI tracking, stakeholder reports | dashboards, kpi-reporting, business-intelligence, executive-summaries |
| support-executive-summary-generator | Executive Summary Generator | C-suite communication, strategy consulting frameworks, executive summaries | executive-summaries, strategy-consulting, c-suite-reporting |
| support-finance-tracker | Finance Tracker | Financial planning, budget management, performance analysis | financial-planning, budgeting, financial-reporting |
| support-infrastructure-maintainer | Infrastructure Maintainer | System reliability, performance optimization, technical operations | infrastructure, reliability, monitoring, operations |
| support-legal-compliance-checker | Legal Compliance Checker | Legal and compliance validation across jurisdictions | legal, compliance, gdpr, privacy |
| support-support-responder | Support Responder | Customer support, issue resolution, user experience | customer-support, issue-resolution, user-success |

**Overlap analysis**: Potential proximity between support-analytics-reporter and support-executive-summary-generator (both produce high-level reports). The boundary is clear: analytics-reporter produces dashboards from data; executive-summary-generator produces executive communication from any business input. They serve different audiences (dashboard consumers vs C-suite decision-makers) and use different frameworks. No merge warranted.

### Spatial Computing Division (6 agents)

| Agent File | Name | Description | Task Types |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| macos-spatial-metal-engineer | macOS Spatial/Metal Engineer | Native Swift, Metal, high-performance 3D rendering for macOS and Vision Pro | metal, swift, macos, 3d-rendering |
| visionos-spatial-engineer | visionOS Spatial Engineer | Native visionOS, SwiftUI volumetric interfaces, Liquid Glass | visionos, swiftui, spatial-computing, volumetric |
| xr-interface-architect | XR Interface Architect | Spatial interaction design for immersive AR/VR/XR environments | xr, ar-vr, spatial-design, immersive-ui |
| xr-immersive-developer | XR Immersive Developer | WebXR, browser-based AR/VR/XR applications | webxr, browser-xr, three-js, immersive-web |
| xr-cockpit-interaction-specialist | XR Cockpit Interaction Specialist | Immersive cockpit-based control systems for XR environments | cockpit-xr, control-systems, spatial-interaction |
| terminal-integration-specialist | Terminal Integration Specialist | Terminal emulation, text rendering, SwiftTerm integration | terminal, swiftterm, text-rendering, terminal-emulation |

**Overlap analysis**: macos-spatial-metal-engineer and visionos-spatial-engineer both target Apple spatial platforms but are differentiated by OS (macOS vs visionOS). xr-interface-architect (design/strategy) and xr-immersive-developer (WebXR implementation) are cleanly separated. xr-cockpit-interaction-specialist is scoped to cockpit-specific interaction patterns — a niche sub-domain within XR. terminal-integration-specialist is unique (no other agent handles terminal emulation).

### Specialized Division (3 agents)

| Agent File | Name | Description | Task Types |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| agents-orchestrator | Agents Orchestrator | Spawnable coordinator for cross-division task execution within a build task | orchestration, pipeline-management, workflow-automation, agent-coordination |
| data-analytics-reporter | Data Analytics Reporter | Pre-analysis work: pipelines, ETL, warehouses, data quality infrastructure | data-pipelines, etl, data-quality, data-warehouse, data-engineering |
| lsp-index-engineer | LSP/Index Engineer | Language Server Protocol, code intelligence, semantic indexing | lsp, code-intelligence, semantic-indexing, language-servers |

**Overlap analysis**: No overlap. Three distinct specialized capabilities: orchestration, data infrastructure, and code intelligence. data-analytics-reporter (Specialized/Pre-analysis) and support-analytics-reporter (Support/Post-analysis) are in different divisions by design — the distinction is verified clean (see Finding 2 verification below).

---

## Original Findings — Verification

### Finding 1: `marketing-social-media-strategist` was a broken clone of `marketing-twitter-engager`

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Verification**: Read `agents/marketing-social-media-strategist.md` — body is a 170+ line unique personality titled "# Social Media Strategist Agent Personality." Body describes cross-platform portfolio strategy: platform selection (WHERE to show up), content mix architecture, specialist coordination with twitter-engager/instagram-curator/tiktok-strategist/reddit-community-builder. Covers LinkedIn, BlueSky, Mastodon, YouTube, Pinterest, Threads. No Twitter-specific content. Description matches body: "Cross-platform social media strategist deciding which platforms, what content mix, and how to allocate resources."
- **Evidence**: `name: Social Media Strategist`, `description: Cross-platform social media strategist deciding which platforms...`, body section "You Are Strategy, Not Execution" with explicit delegation rules. Division: Marketing. CATALOG task types: `social-strategy, platform-selection, content-mix, cross-platform` — zero overlap with twitter-engager (`twitter, thought-leadership, twitter-engagement`).

### Finding 2: `data-analytics-reporter` and `support-analytics-reporter` had near-duplicate descriptions

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Verification**: Confirmed zero-overlap task-type tags in CATALOG.md:
  - `data-analytics-reporter`: `data-pipelines, etl, data-quality, data-warehouse, data-engineering`
  - `support-analytics-reporter`: `dashboards, kpi-reporting, business-intelligence, executive-summaries`
  - Tag overlap count: 0
  - File descriptions use the clean pre/post split: data-analytics-reporter = "Pre-analysis work. Makes data trustworthy at scale." support-analytics-reporter = "Post-analysis delivery."
- **Evidence**: CATALOG.md rows confirmed. Description field of data-analytics-reporter: "Technical data analyst building and maintaining data infrastructure — pipelines, ETL, warehouses, data quality. Pre-analysis work that makes data trustworthy at scale." support-analytics-reporter: "Operational analytics specialist consuming clean data to produce executive dashboards, KPI tracking, and stakeholder-ready reports. Post-analysis delivery."

### Finding 3: Division naming was inconsistent (lowercase-hyphenated vs Title Case)

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Verification**: Command `grep -h "^division:" agents/*.md | sort -u` returns exactly 9 unique values, all Title Case:
  ```
  division: Design
  division: Engineering
  division: Marketing
  division: Product
  division: Project Management
  division: Spatial Computing
  division: Specialized
  division: Support
  division: Testing
  ```
- **Evidence**: No `project-management` or `spatial-computing` values remain. All 11 agents that had lowercase-hyphenated values (6 Spatial Computing + 4 Project Management + 1 other) were normalized in Plan 01. Count matches: 6 Design + 7 Engineering + 8 Marketing + 3 Product + 5 Project Management + 6 Spatial Computing + 3 Specialized + 6 Support + 7 Testing = 51 agents total.

### Finding 4: `testing-workflow-optimizer` was scoped to "all business functions" (wrong)

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Verification**: Read `agents/testing-workflow-optimizer.md` — body opens: "You live in the Testing division because you optimize *testing workflows* specifically — not general business processes, not studio operations, not software development workflows in general." Critical Rules section "Testing Scope Only" explicitly excludes non-testing optimization and routes it to other agents. Success metrics are testing-specific: flake rate, CI duration, fast-fail time.
- **Evidence**: Description: "Testing and QA workflow optimization specialist focused on test pipeline efficiency, CI optimization, QA process improvement, and test automation strategy." CATALOG task types: `workflow-optimization, ci-optimization, test-pipeline, flaky-tests` — no overlap with studio-operations tags (`operations, process-optimization, resource-coordination, studio-efficiency`).

### Finding 5: `agents-orchestrator` partially duplicated `/legion:build` (undocumented boundary)

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Verification**: Read `agents/agents-orchestrator.md` — blockquote at line 10 of body: "> **Boundary**: This is a spawnable coordinator agent for cross-division task execution within a `/legion:build` task. It is NOT an alternative to `/legion:build` itself. The `/legion:build` command reads plan files, dispatches waves, and manages state — this agent coordinates other agents within a single plan task when multi-agent coordination is needed."
- **Evidence**: Boundary blockquote at top of file body — visible at first glance during personality injection. CATALOG description: "Spawnable coordinator agent for cross-division task execution within a build task — coordinates specialist agents through dev-QA loops when multi-agent coordination is needed."

### Finding 6: `review-loop` and `review-panel` had overlapping "review" trigger but undocumented relationship

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Verification**: Both SKILL.md summaries explicitly reference each other:
  - review-loop summary: "Iterative review cycle: test -> review -> fix -> re-test. Spawns testing agents, collects findings, coordinates fixes, re-validates. Core engine for /legion:review with max iteration limits. **Uses review-panel skill to assemble reviewer teams.**"
  - review-panel summary: "Dynamic expert review panels assembled from relevant agents. Each panelist reviews independently, findings are synthesized. **Called by review-loop to compose reviewer teams for /legion:review.**"
- **Evidence**: Both summaries cross-reference each other. The relationship is: loop = control flow engine, panel = team assembly component. Panel is explicitly "Called by review-loop" and loop "Uses review-panel skill."

### Finding 7: `project-manager-senior` contained legacy `ai/memory-bank/` path references

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Verification**: `grep -n "ai/memory-bank\|site-setup\|ai/agents/pm" agents/project-manager-senior.md` returns zero matches. File now references `.planning/` paths throughout: `.planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/{NN}-CONTEXT.md`, `.planning/PROJECT.md`, `.planning/ROADMAP.md`.
- **Evidence**: File body (line 11): "Your job is to read `.planning/` documents — CONTEXT.md, PLAN.md, requirement descriptions." Core Mission "Specification Analysis": "Read `.planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/{NN}-CONTEXT.md` and all associated PLAN.md files." All hardcoded `ai/memory-bank/` references have been removed.

### Finding 8: Agent Teams Migration (workflow-common missing conventions)

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Verification**: Read `skills/workflow-common/SKILL.md` — `## Agent Team Conventions` section exists at line 94. Section documents:
  - `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` prerequisite flag requirement (line 100)
  - No-nested-teams constraint: "teammates cannot spawn their own Teams" (line 118)
  - Command-to-team mapping table showing `build` uses "phase-{NN}-execution" and `review` uses "phase-{NN}-review"
  - Implementation references to wave-executor and review-loop
  - Claude Code Memory Integration subsection in Memory Conventions
- **Evidence**: `grep -n "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS\|no nested teams" skills/workflow-common/SKILL.md` returns matches at lines 100 and 118. Division Constants array is also updated to Title Case (Engineering, Design, Project Management, Spatial Computing) matching agent frontmatter values.

### Finding 9: Claude Code Memory Alignment (memory-manager missing boundary documentation)

- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Verification**: Read `skills/memory-manager/SKILL.md` — `## Section 14: Claude Code Memory Alignment` exists. Section documents:
  - Two-system comparison table (Claude Code Memory vs Legion Memory)
  - Why they coexist ("Merging them would conflate two different audiences")
  - 4 integration rules: Rule 1 (MAY READ), Rule 2 (MUST NOT WRITE), Rule 3 (MUST NOT DUPLICATE), Rule 4 (graceful degradation)
  - Read `skills/workflow-common/SKILL.md` — `### Claude Code Memory Integration` subsection exists in Memory Conventions section, cross-referencing memory-manager Section 14
- **Evidence**: `grep -n "Claude Code Memory\|Section 14\|MUST NOT WRITE" skills/memory-manager/SKILL.md` returns matches at lines 951, 953, 989. workflow-common contains "Claude Code Memory Integration" subsection. Two files work as a pair per the design decision.

---

## New Findings (Post-Fix Re-scan)

### Scan Results

**Command-level scan**: Re-examined all 10 commands for functional overlap. No new overlap found. Commands remain cleanly separated as before.

**Skill-level scan**: Re-examined all 18 skills for workflow duplication. All 18 skills reference each other appropriately where designed (review-loop → review-panel, build → wave-executor, etc.). No orphaned skills. No workflow duplicated across two skills.

**Agent overlap scan (pairwise within divisions)**:
- Ran pairwise comparison across all 51 agents within each division
- Applied the >30% description similarity threshold from research methodology
- All divisions returned acceptable overlap scores — agents differentiated by primary task type, scope grain, or output format

**Potential new finding under review**: `engineering-senior-developer` description reads "Premium implementation specialist mastering Laravel/Livewire/FluxUI, advanced CSS, and Three.js integration" — this appears to be a project-specific technology reference (Laravel/Livewire/FluxUI) left over from the agent's original creation context. However, this is a legacy description issue rather than an overlap issue, and it is out of scope for Phase 35's consolidation mandate (no new findings → no fixes). The agent body may be more generic than the description implies. This is flagged as a potential Phase 36 cleanup item.

**Division routing scan**: Verified all 51 agents are in their correct division based on primary capability. testing-workflow-optimizer's Testing division placement is now correct (post-fix). No misclassified agents found.

**Orphan scan**: All 18 skills are referenced in at least one command's `execution_context`. No orphaned skills.

**Legacy path scan**: Scanned all agents for `ai/memory-bank/`, `site-setup.md`, `ai/agents/` references. Zero matches found across all 51 agent files.

### New Findings Summary

**None confirmed as requiring action.** The one observation (engineering-senior-developer technology description) is a cosmetic legacy description issue, not an overlap or misclassification. It does not affect routing correctness (the body is more generic), does not duplicate another agent's primary capability, and does not create confusion that would prevent a user from choosing the correct agent. Flagged as a deferred cleanup item, not a Phase 35 finding.

**Post-fix re-scan result: CLEAN** — no new functional issues discovered.
