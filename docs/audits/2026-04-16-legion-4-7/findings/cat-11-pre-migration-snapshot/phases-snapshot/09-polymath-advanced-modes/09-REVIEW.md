## Success Criteria Verification

- [x] `/legion:explore` offers mode selection: crystallize (existing), onboard, compare, debate
- [x] Onboard mode guides structured codebase familiarization with progressive depth
- [x] Compare mode produces structured comparison matrix with decision capture
- [x] Debate mode supports adversarial exploration with winner tracking (DPO-inspired)
- [x] All modes enforce structured choices (no open-ended questions)

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Reviewer | Verdict | Key Observations |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| testing-workflow-optimizer | PASS | Workflow patterns are complete and consistent across all 4 modes. Exchange patterns well-defined. Example flow only shows crystallize (suggestion). |
| testing-qa-verification-specialist | PASS | All verification thresholds met. DPO scoring mechanism well-documented with clear signal mappings. Blind spots exchange correctly marked optional. |
| agents-orchestrator | PASS | Mode selection infrastructure cleanly extends existing Polymath. Agent coordination patterns preserved. Frontmatter metadata could be enriched (suggestion). |

## Suggestions (not required)

| # | File | Issue | Reviewer |
|---|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | `agents/polymath.md` | Frontmatter `description` still says "crystallization specialist" — could mention new modes | agents-orchestrator |
| 2 | `commands/explore.md` | `example_flow` section only shows crystallize example — could add mode examples | testing-workflow-optimizer |
| 3 | `agents/polymath.md` | `review_strengths` frontmatter doesn't reflect new mode capabilities | agents-orchestrator |
| 4 | `commands/explore.md` | Version still "1.0.0" and "Phase 36" reference — cosmetic | testing-workflow-optimizer |
| 5 | `skills/polymath-engine/SKILL.md` | Debate scoring template blind spots row should note conditional | testing-qa-verification-specialist |
