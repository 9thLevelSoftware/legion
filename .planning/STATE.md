# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Turn 51 isolated agent personalities into a functional AI legion — "My name is Legion, for we are many."

## Current Position

Milestone: v4.0 — Inspiration Audit Adoption
Status: Active — 0/6 phases complete
Last activity: 2026-03-02 — Milestone initialized from inspiration audit plan

Progress: [..........] 0% (0/6 phases complete)

## v4.0 Phase Map

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Depends On | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 29 | Progressive Disclosure | PRG-01, PRG-02 | — | Pending |
| 30 | Review & Verification | REV-01, REV-02, REV-03 | — | Pending |
| 31 | Behavioral Guardrails | DSC-01, DSC-02 | — | Pending |
| 32 | Planning Intelligence | PLN-01, PLN-02 | Phase 29 | Pending |
| 33 | Knowledge & Memory | KNW-01, KNW-02, KNW-03 | Phase 31 | Pending |
| 34 | Execution Resilience | EXE-01, EXE-02, EXE-03 | Phase 30, 33 | Pending |

**Parallel wave 1:** Phases 29, 30, 31 (no dependencies — can execute simultaneously)
**Wave 2:** Phase 32 (needs 29), Phase 33 (needs 31)
**Wave 3:** Phase 34 (needs 30 + 33)

| v3.0 | 5 | 6 | 13 | 2026-03-02 |

## What's Deployed

- 10 commands (`/legion:start`, `plan`, `build`, `review`, `status`, `quick`, `portfolio`, `milestone`, `agent`, `advise`)
- 17 skills (agent-registry, phase-decomposer, wave-executor, review-loop, review-panel, plan-critique, + 11 more)
- 51 agents across 9 divisions
- Plugin manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — name: `legion`, version: `3.0.0`
- Repository: `https://github.com/9thLevelSoftware/legion`

## Next Steps

Run `/gsd:plan-phase 29` (or 30, 31 — all unblocked) to begin execution.

## Session Continuity

### Key Decisions (carried forward)

- Full personality injection for all agent spawns
- /legion: namespace for all commands (v3.0 rebrand)
- Plugin name: legion
- Minimal state: PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Balanced cost: Opus planning, Sonnet execution
- Hybrid agent selection: recommend → confirm
- Wave-based execution with max 3 tasks per plan
- Plugin-relative paths: `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` at root
- Three-layer read-only for advisory
- Dynamic review panels over fixed board of directors
- Pre-mortem + assumption hunting for plan critique

### v4.0 Design Decisions

- Cherry-pick from 10 inspiration sources, don't wholesale adopt any
- Maintain Legion's core identity: personality-first, wave execution, human-readable state
- Anti-patterns documented as guardrails (no agent inflation, no 50-iteration loops, no full automation without checkpoints)
