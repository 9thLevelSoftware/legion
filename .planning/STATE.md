Progress: [███       ] 20% (5 phases planned, 3 plans executed, 6 requirements delivered)

## Shipped Milestones

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Requirements | Shipped |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| v1.0 | 14 | 30 | 54 | 2026-03-01 |

## What's Deployed

- 11 commands (`/legion:start`, `plan`, `build`, `review`, `status`, `quick`, `portfolio`, `milestone`, `agent`, `advise`, `explore`)

## Next Steps

v5.0 milestone initialized with 32 requirements across 5 phases.

**Phase 36 — Polymath Integration:** 
- Plan 01 complete (Polymath agent + /legion:explore command)

## Session Continuity

### Key Decisions (carried forward)

- Full personality injection for all agent spawns
- /legion: namespace for all commands (v3.0 rebrand)
- Plugin name: legion
- Minimal state: PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Balanced cost: Opus planning, Sonnet execution
- Hybrid agent selection: recommend → confirm
- Wave-based execution with max 3 tasks per plan
- Plugin-relative paths: `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` at root
- Three-layer read-only for advisory
- Dynamic review panels over fixed board of directors
- Pre-mortem + assumption hunting for plan critique
- Competing architecture proposals: opt-in, 3 philosophies (Minimal, Clean, Pragmatic)
- Spec pipeline: optional 5-stage pre-coding specification
- Polymath engine: research-first exploration with structured choice protocol
- Cherry-pick from 10 inspiration sources, don't wholesale adopt any
- Maintain Legion's core identity: personality-first, wave execution, human-readable state
- Anti-patterns documented as guardrails (no agent inflation, no 50-iteration loops, no full automation without checkpoints)
- Polymath structured choice: arrow keys + Enter, max 7 exchanges
- Gap detection taxonomy: 5 categories (technical, scope, constraint, dependency, risk)
- Exploration output: crystallized summary or explicit park decision
- Exploration integration: Optional Step 2 in /legion:start, default "Yes" but skippable
- Seamless transition: Crystallized summary pre-populates Stage 1 questioning
- Park preservation: Exploration output saved to `.planning/exploration-{timestamp}.md`
- Specificity hierarchy: tool/framework > subdomain > broad domain > general for conflict resolution
- BLOCKER severity overrides domain ownership per authority conflict resolution rules
- Authority constraints injected proactively into agent prompts, not just reactive filtering
- All 53 agents mapped with exclusive domains across 9 divisions
