# Plan 01-03 Summary — Schema Conformance Tests

## Status: Complete

## Agent

## What Changed
Created a comprehensive test suite for v6.0 plan schema conformance with test fixtures and reusable validation functions.

## Files Created
- `tests/plan-schema-conformance.test.js` — 16 test cases across 5 suites
- `tests/fixtures/plan-valid-v6.md` — Valid plan fixture with all v6.0 fields
- `tests/fixtures/plan-missing-verification.md` — Invalid plan missing verification_commands
- `tests/fixtures/plan-overlap-forbidden.md` — Invalid plan with files_modified/files_forbidden overlap

## Test Coverage
- **verification_commands**: 4 tests (valid array, missing BLOCKER, empty BLOCKER, non-empty strings)
- **files_forbidden**: 5 tests (valid array, missing WARNING, overlap BLOCKER, empty valid, directory prefix matching)
- **expected_artifacts**: 4 tests (valid structure, missing WARNING, required-in-modified check, structure validation)
- **Phase 1 self-validation**: 3 tests (01-01, 01-02, 01-03 all pass schema checks)

## Verification Results
All verification commands passed. 16/16 tests pass.

## Requirements Covered
- DSC-01: `files_forbidden` field validation
- DSC-02: `expected_artifacts` field validation
- DSC-03: `verification_commands` mandatory enforcement

## Issues
Pre-existing test failure in `installer-smoke.test.js` (checksum verification) — unrelated to this change.
