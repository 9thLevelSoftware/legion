## Findings Detail

| # | Severity | File | Issue | Reviewer(s) | Status |
|---|----------|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | WARNING | tests/plan-schema-conformance.test.js:159 | `.md` treated as code file in `validateFilesForbidden` — stricter than plan-critique spec | reality-checker, pm-shepherd | Noted — non-blocking |
| 2 | WARNING | tests/plan-schema-conformance.test.js:97 | Parser hardcodes `- path:` as nested object trigger — fragile to reordering | evidence-collector | Noted — non-blocking |
| 3 | WARNING | tests/plan-schema-conformance.test.js:44 | Parser doesn't handle `must_haves` 2-level nesting (latent) | evidence-collector | Noted — non-blocking |
| 4 | SUGGESTION | tests/plan-schema-conformance.test.js | Missing negative test: required artifact not in files_modified | evidence-collector | Deferred |
| 5 | SUGGESTION | tests/plan-schema-conformance.test.js | No test for comment-only verification commands | pm-shepherd | Deferred |
| 6 | SUGGESTION | tests/plan-schema-conformance.test.js | detectFileOverlap separate from validateFilesForbidden | reality-checker | Deferred |
| 7 | SUGGESTION | tests/plan-schema-conformance.test.js | No legacy plan exemption test | reality-checker | Deferred |
| 8 | SUGGESTION | skills/plan-critique/SKILL.md | Rule-to-report-column mapping not explicitly stated | pm-shepherd | Deferred |
| 9 | SUGGESTION | tests/fixtures/ | Directory prefix overlap only tested synthetically | evidence-collector | Deferred |

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Reviewer | Verdict | Key Observations |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| testing-qa-verification-specialist | PASS | Schema fields complete, validation rules accurate, verdict integration correct, contract/quality distinction clear |
| testing-evidence-collector | PASS | 16/16 tests pass, fixtures realistic, verification commands meaningful, self-validation works |
| project-management-project-shepherd | PASS | Cross-reference integrity solid, requirements DSC-01/02/03 fully traceable, no downstream breakage expected |

## Suggestions (not required — for future hardening)
1. Remove `.md` from code-file detection in `validateFilesForbidden` to match plan-critique spec (Finding 1)
2. Add negative test for required artifact not in files_modified (Finding 4)
3. Add comment-only command check to `validateVerificationCommands` (Finding 5)
4. Add legacy plan exemption test (Finding 7)
