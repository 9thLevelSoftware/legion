# Phase 31, Plan 01 — Summary

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Anti-rationalization table for testing-qa-verification-specialist
Added "Common Rationalizations I Reject" section (line 203) with 8 entries covering testing/QA excuses:
- "Tests are too slow to run right now"
- "It works on my machine"
- "We'll add tests later"
- "The code is too simple to test"
- "Mocking is too complex for this"
- "The QA agent already approved it"
- "It passes in CI"
- "We're just prototyping"

Each entry has a concrete, personality-consistent response matching Reality Checker's skeptical, evidence-obsessed identity.

### Task 2: Anti-rationalization table for engineering-senior-developer
Added "Common Rationalizations I Reject" section (line 131) with 7 entries covering code quality excuses:
- "It's just a quick fix"
- "We can refactor later"
- "It's not worth the abstraction"
- "Performance doesn't matter here"
- "The framework handles that"
- "Nobody will read this code"
- "It's just a style preference"

Each entry has a concrete response matching Senior Developer's detail-oriented, quality-driven identity.

### Task 3: Authority matrix in CLAUDE.md
Added "Authority Matrix" section (line 64) with three subsections:
- **Autonomous**: 6 decisions agents can make without asking (file edits in scope, tests, declared deps, formatting, planned files, commits)
- **Human Approval Required**: 8 decisions requiring confirmation (architecture, unplanned deps, out-of-scope files, schema, API contracts, deletion, CI/CD, overriding reviews)
- **Escalation Protocol**: 4-step process (stop, document, continue, never rationalize)

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agents/testing-qa-verification-specialist.md` | Added 🚧 Common Rationalizations I Reject section (8 entries) |
| `agents/engineering-senior-developer.md` | Added 🚧 Common Rationalizations I Reject section (7 entries) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Added Authority Matrix section with autonomous/approval/escalation subsections |

## Verification

- [x] testing-qa-verification-specialist.md: "Common Rationalizations I Reject" table with 8 entries (≥5 required)
- [x] engineering-senior-developer.md: "Common Rationalizations I Reject" table with 7 entries (≥5 required)
- [x] CLAUDE.md: Authority Matrix with Autonomous, Human Approval Required, and Escalation Protocol subsections
- [x] All tables use consistent Rationalization | My Response / Decision | Scope/Why format
- [x] Section ordering preserved: guardrails before communication style, authority matrix before memory layer
- [x] No existing content modified — additions only
