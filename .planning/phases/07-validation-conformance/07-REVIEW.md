## Findings Detail

| # | Severity | File | Issue | Fix Applied | Cycle Fixed |
|---|----------|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | BLOCKER | adapters/copilot-cli.md | agent_spawning: true contradicts known_quirks no-agent-spawning | Removed contradicting quirk | 1 |
| 2 | BLOCKER | adapters/opencode.md | agent_spawning: true contradicts known_quirks no-agent-spawning | Removed contradicting quirk | 1 |
| 3 | WARNING | tests/adapter-conformance.test.js | Only 9/14 required tool concepts validated | Added 5 missing: shutdown_agents, cleanup_coordination, global_config_dir, plugin_discovery_glob, commit_signature | 1 |
| 4 | WARNING | tests/adapter-conformance.test.js | No cross-validation between capabilities and quirks | Added Capability-Quirk Consistency describe block | 1 |
| 5 | WARNING | tests/adapter-conformance.test.js | Parser key regex excludes hyphens | Widened to [a-z][a-z0-9_-]* | 1 |
| 6 | WARNING | tests/adapter-conformance.test.js | Hardcoded nestable object names | Added maintainability comment | 1 |
| 7 | WARNING | tests/adapter-conformance.test.js | getMarkdownBody() split on --- is lossy | Replaced with indexOf-based extraction | 1 |
| 8 | WARNING | tests/cross-reference-validation.test.js | Weak includes() substring match for back-refs | Strengthened to regex with pipe delimiters | 1 |
| 9 | WARNING | tests/lint-commands.test.js | Missing context section checks | Added context/context tags and orphan detection | 1 |
| 10 | WARNING | tests/cross-reference-validation.test.js | Missing command-to-agent reference check | Covered by strengthened bidirectional catalog checks | 1 |

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Reviewer | Rubric | Cycle 1 Verdict | Cycle 2 Verdict | Key Observations |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| testing-qa-verification-specialist | Production Readiness | NEEDS WORK | PASS | Found 2 BLOCKER adapter contradictions, missing tool concept coverage |
| engineering-senior-developer | Code Architecture | PASS | — | Parser DRY concern noted as future cleanup, no blockers |
| testing-test-results-analyzer | Test Quality Metrics | NEEDS WORK | PASS | Missing plan-specified checks, weak assertions |

## Suggestions (noted, not required)

1. No canonical vocabulary for known_quirks values in ADAPTER.md (freeform acceptable in v1)
2. 4 separate YAML parsers across test files — extract shared helper in future cleanup
3. No negative test cases — add synthetic malformed input tests in future
4. Tool mappings check is body-wide, not scoped to section heading

## Test Results

```
Cycle 2 (post-fix):
node --test tests/adapter-conformance.test.js tests/cross-reference-validation.test.js tests/lint-commands.test.js — 466/466 pass
Full suite: 1002/1003 pass (1 pre-existing installer-smoke checksum failure)
```
