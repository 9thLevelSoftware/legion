## Findings Detail

| # | Severity | File | Issue | Fix Applied | Cycle Fixed |
|---|----------|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | WARNING | tests/mocks/control-modes.json | Description strings used `--` (ASCII double dash) instead of `—` (em dash) from YAML source | Replaced all `--` with `—` in profile descriptions and when_to_use values | 1 |
| 2 | WARNING | tests/control-modes.test.js | No negative/edge-case tests — only happy path validated | Added 5 edge-case tests: invalid mode rejection, extra flag detection, string-vs-boolean guard, duplicate detection, description validation | 1 |

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Reviewer | Rubric Focus | Final Verdict | Key Observations |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| testing-qa-verification-specialist | Schema correctness, data integrity | PASS | All 7 criteria clean — config, schema, settings, fixture, flags, cross-references, and fallbacks all consistent |
| testing-workflow-optimizer | Workflow integration, protocol consistency | PASS | Single resolution point confirmed, flag-not-name pattern followed, backward compatibility maintained. 1 false positive (docs/control-modes.md exists) |
| engineering-senior-developer | Code quality, test coverage, documentation | NEEDS WORK → PASS | 2 warnings fixed in cycle 1: fixture dash characters and missing edge-case tests. Documentation thorough and accurate |

## Suggestions

None — all findings were WARNING severity and resolved.

## Test Results

- Control modes test suite: 23/23 pass (18 original + 5 new edge cases)
